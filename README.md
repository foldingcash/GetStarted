# GetStarted
This repo is meant to provide various instructions in helping users get started with FoldingCash

## Using BCH/SLP Address

Ideally your Folding@Home address will be configured as {username}_{BCH/SLP}. This will allow us to use your BCH/SLP address directly.

We have used memo.cash and Bitcoin.com (android wallet) to help manage our BCH and SLP.

We recommend using a dedicated SLP wallet for you FoldingCash

## Recovering FoldingCash From BTC Addresses

If you've received FoldingCash at a BTC address that was stored in CounterWallet, then you will need to do the following:

1. Collect the private key from the address that contains the FoldingCash
2. Move XCP and other tokens from this address to ensure no replay-attacks can be performed ***is this an actual problem?***
3. Convert the WIF to the compressed WIF ***Need to confirm and provide instructions on the conversion process***
4. Create a new account with memo.cash
5. Instead of creating a new wallet, import and provide the compressed WIF
6. You know have access to your FoldingCash
7. We recommend creating a dedicated wallet for SLP to ensure there is no posibility of lose of coins
